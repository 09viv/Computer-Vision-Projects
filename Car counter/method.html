    <h1>Car Counter</h1>
    <p>This project utilizes several computer vision techniques to accurately detect and count cars in a video feed.</p>

    <h2>1. Background Subtraction</h2>
    <p>The system uses background subtraction to isolate moving objects (vehicles) from the static background. The <code>createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2</code> method from OpenCV is employed, which is effective in detecting shadows and variations in the background.</p>

    <h2>2. Contour Detection</h2>
    <p>Once the moving objects are isolated, contours are detected using the <code>findContours</code> function. This function identifies the boundaries of the detected vehicles.</p>

    <h2>3. Vehicle Counting</h2>
    <p>The system maintains a list of detected vehicles and counts how many cross a predefined counting line. This is done by checking the position of the center points of the detected vehicles against the counting line.</p>

    <h2>4. HTML Reporting</h2>
    <p>The current vehicle count is saved in an HTML file each time a vehicle crosses the counting line, providing a simple way to review the results.</p>

    <h2>5. Libraries Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>OpenCV</code>: For image processing and computer vision tasks.</li>
        <li><code>NumPy</code>: For numerical operations and array manipulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Real-Time Processing</h2>
    <p>The system processes video frames in real-time, providing immediate feedback on vehicle counts as they pass through the detection line.</p>
